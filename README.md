How it Works
Once you have created an account on QuickEssays, you can create a new essay by filling out the required fields in the guideline. Our server will then use the information you provided to engineer a prompt for OpenAI's language model, which will generate the essay.

If you are not satisfied with the result, you can retry the essay a certain number of times depending on the plan you have chosen. However, you cannot change the initial values you set for the title, about, length, style, tone, audience, perspective, and type of essay.

## Payment
